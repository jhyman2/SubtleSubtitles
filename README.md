SubtleSubtitles
===============

This Java Desktop Application overlays subtitles on any movie or TV show on any program.  This is a universal application
that can be used overtop of any other program such as Chrome, Firefox, Windows Media Player, VLC player, and more.  The
subtitles will be displayed and will appear to be part of the movie.

The purpose of this program is to provide the user the ability to watch a movie or TV show with subtitles while using a program that has no other way of including correct subtitles.  This will also work with any language as long as the character encoding is UTF-8.

Instructions:
- Download the runnable jar, SubtleSubtitles.jar, and run using the Java Runtime Environment (1.7 or higher).
- Download the .SRT file for the movie or TV show.  My favorite site for subtitles is http://www.opensubtitles.org/
- Prepare your movie by opening the application that will run it with the movie ready to play.
- Click "Open a file" to load the subtitles.
- Click Play on the movie and then "Start" on this application.
- Use the slider to adjust the positioning of the subtitles if they are behind or ahead.
- Press Windows Key + H to hide/show the border and buttons of this application while the movie is playing.

Extras:
- Use the color picker to change the text color
- Press ALT+F and ALT+E to exit the program.

Once I learn more Javascript, I would like to make a Chrome extension with the same concept.  Let me know if you'd
be interested in seeing this development.

Please send feedback to jhyman2@umbc.edu.  Feel free to fork and improve.  I'd love to see other's edits.

Thanks for looking!
